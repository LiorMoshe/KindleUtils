This repository will get updated over time with the scripts that I intend
to use to move my notes from kindle to other tools (Anki, Notion etc).
Currently my main usage is to extract highlights of single words
and use google translate's API to extract a text file of all the translations
of those words to hebrew using converter.py

Usage:
python converter.py <book_name>

Note: You need to make sure that kindle's clippings text file is in the
current directory of the script.
